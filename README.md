# Bank-Churn-Analysis
I developed a comprehensive project in Excel, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages ,including data preprocessing ,data cleaning, and data visualization.

###Dataset Description

###This dataset contains information about 500 bank customers and is designed to help understand factors contributing to customer churn. The dataset includes the following variables:

•	CustomerID: A unique identifier for each customer.

•	Surname: The last name of the customer.

•	CreditScore: A score between 350 and 850 that represents the customer's creditworthiness.

•	Geography: The country or region where the customer resides (France, Spain, or Germany).

•	Gender: The customer's gender (Male or Female).

•	Age: The customer's age.

•	Tenure: The number of years the customer has been with the bank.

•	Balance: The customer's bank account balance.

•	NumOfProducts: The number of banking products the customer uses.

•	HasCrCard: Indicates whether the customer has a credit card with the bank (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

•	IsActiveMember: Indicates whether the customer is an active member (1 = Active, 0 = Inactive).

•	EstimatedSalary: The estimated salary of the customer.

•	Churn: Indicates whether the customer has left the bank (1 = Yes, 0 = No).



Analytical Questions

Please address the following analytical questions using Pivot Tables in Excel:

1.	What is the average credit score for each geography?
	
2.	How does the average account balance vary between genders within each country?
	
3.	What is the distribution of active members versus non-active members according to having credit card?
	
4.	What is the customer churn rate per number of products used?

Please address the following research questions using Data Analysis ToolPak in Excel:

1.	Is there any significant difference in customers' average earning between churned and not-churned?
   
2.	Is there any significant difference in customers' average credit scores among customers' geographic location?
